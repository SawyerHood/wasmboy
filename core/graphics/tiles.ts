  // A line of 8 pixels on a single tile, is represented by 2 bytes.
  // since a single tile is 8x8 pixels, 8 * 2 = 16 bytes

  // Get the tile ID's tile addess from tile data.
  // For instance, let's say our first line of tile data represents tiles for letters:
  // a b c d e f g
  // And we have tileId 0x02. That means we want the tile for the 'c' character
  // Since each tile is 16 bytes, it would be the starting tileDataAddress + (tileId * tileSize), to skip over tiles we dont want
  // The whole signed thing is weird, and has something to do how the second set of tile data is stored :p
  if (tileDataMemoryLocation === Graphics.memoryLocationTileDataSelectZeroStart) {
    // Treat the tile Id as a signed int, subtract an offset of 128
    // if the tileId was 0 then the tile would be in memory region 0x9000-0x900F

      tileIdFromTileMap -= 128;
    } else {

  // if the background layout gave us the tileId 0, then the tile data would be between 0x8000-0x800F.
